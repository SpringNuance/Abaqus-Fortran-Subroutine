# Abaqus-VUMAT-elastic_damage
Abaqus VUMAT subroutine for the linear elastic isotropic materials with damage based on von mises stress for explicit analysis.

Repository contains an input and a subroutine. Linear elastic model is implemented in the subroutine with Von mises stress failure criteria. Material fails without softening (as soon as the stress attains the critical criteria).
