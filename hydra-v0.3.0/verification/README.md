# Verification examples

- [tsl](tsl): tests for the verification of the correct implementation of
  the trapezoidal **t**raction **s**eparation **l**aw in the Abaqus
  cohesive elements, with and without true stress correction.
- [weakC](weakC): tests for the verification of the weakly coupled solution
  procedure.
- [gradient](gradient): tests for validating the hydrostatic stress gradient
  estimate.
