# Abaqus-VUMAT-Gurson_GTN
Numerical impementation of the Gurson model with GTN modification for isotropic materials.

The subroutine is apt for explicit analysis with iteration based on the constraining the upper and lower limit and the algorithm is efficiently implemented to reduce the processing time.
